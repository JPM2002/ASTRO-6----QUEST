# 🌌 Interactive Planetary Simulation in Pygame

## 📚 Introduction
This project is an interactive simulation of our solar system, developed in Python using the Pygame library. It is part of a QUEST initiative, aiming to blend educational concepts in astronomy with engaging simulation technology.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites
Before running the simulation, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### ⚙️ Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone [repository-url]`.

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended)
   - Navigate to the cloned directory.
   - Create a virtual environment by running `python -m venv venv`.
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows, run `venv\Scripts\activate`.
     - On Unix or MacOS, run `source venv/bin/activate`.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Install the following dependencies:
     ```sh
     pip install pygame
     ```
     **Note:** The `math` and `time` modules are part of the Python Standard Library and do not require installation via pip.

### 🌟 Running the Simulation
- Run the simulation by executing `python main.py` from the root directory of the project.

## 💡 Features
- Realistic planetary orbits simulation.
- Interactive controls to adjust simulation parameters.
- Educational insights into planetary motion and gravitational forces.
